# High-Performance Heartbeat TCP Server

This project demonstrates how to build a high-performance TCP server in .NET, specifically designed to handle heartbeat messages from numerous IoT devices. It leverages the `Socket` class for efficient network communication and incorporates advanced techniques like concurrency, non-blocking I/O, and event-driven programming.
